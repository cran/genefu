\title{
Function to quantify stability of feature ranking.
}
\description{
This function computes several indexes to quantify feature ranking stability for several number of selected features. This is usually estimated through perturbation of the original dataset by generating multiple set of selected features.
}
\usage{
stab.fs.ranking(fsets, sizes, N, method = c("kuncheva", "davis"), ...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{fsets}{ list or matrix of sets of selected features (in rows), each ranking must have the same size }
  \item{sizes}{ Number of top-ranked features for which the stability index must be computed
}
  \item{N}{ total number of features on which feature selection is performed }
  \item{method}{ stability index (see details section) }
  \item{\dots}{ additional parameters passed to stability index (\code{penalty} that is a numeric for Davis' stability index, see details section) }
}
\details{
Stability indices may use different parameters. In this version only the Davis index requires an additional parameter that is \code{penalty}, a numeric value used as penalty term.

Kuncheva index (\code{kuncheva}) lay in [-1, 1], An index of -1 means no intersection between sets of selected features, +1 means that all the same features are always selected and 0 is the expected stability of a random feature selection.

Davis index (\code{davis}) lay in [0,1], With a pnalty term equal to 0, an index of 0 means no intersection between sets of selected features and +1 means that all the same features are always selected. Until now, no estimate of the expected stability of a random feature selection was published.
}
\value{ A vector of numeric that are stability indices for each size of the sets of selected features given the rankings

\examples{
## 100 random selection of 50 features from a set of 10,000 features
fsets <- lapply(as.list(1:100), function(x, size=50, N=10000) { return(sample(1:N, size, replace=FALSE))} )

## Kuncheva index
stab.fs.ranking(fsets=fsets, sizes=c(1, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50), N=10000, method="kuncheva")
## close to 0 as expected for a random feature selection

## Davis index
stab.fs.ranking(fsets=fsets, sizes=c(1, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50), N=10000, method="davis", penalty=1)

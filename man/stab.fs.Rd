\title{
Function to quantify stability of feature selection.
}
\description{
This function computes several indexes to quantify feature selection stability. This is usually estimated through perturbation of the original dataset by generating multiple set of selected features.
}
\usage{
stab.fs(fsets, N, method = c("kuncheva", "davis"), ...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{fsets}{ list of sets of selected features, each set of selected features may have different size }
  \item{N}{ total number of features on which feature selection is performed }
  \item{method}{ stability index (see details section) }
  \item{\dots}{ additional parameters passed to stability index (\code{penalty} that is a numeric for Davis' stability index, see details section) }
}
\details{
Stability indices may use different parameters. In this version only the Davis index requires an additional parameter that is \code{penalty}, a numeric value used as penalty term.

Kuncheva index (\code{kuncheva}) lay in [-1, 1], An index of -1 means no intersection between sets of selected features, +1 means that all the same features are always selected and 0 is the expected stability of a random feature selection.

Davis index (\code{davis}) lay in [0,1], With a pnalty term equal to 0, an index of 0 means no intersection between sets of selected features and +1 means that all the same features are always selected. Until now, no estimate of the expected stability of a random feature selection was published.

\value{ A numeric that is the stability index }
